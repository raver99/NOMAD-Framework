# Nextgen Optimized Mobile Application Development (NOMAD ) Framework

NOMAD is a framework that contains best practices, components and solutions to build mobile applications efficiently. 
It aims to provide end to end guidance and support in building mobile applications, from concept to release and maintenance.

Why?
After doing years of mobile application development, you feel that there are a lot of aspects that are repeating themselves across different projects, beyond just code. If structured well, code is easy to be reused. But there is a lot of work, knowledge and experience besides code to that is needed to build mobile apps eficiently.

From idea to app release, there are a lot of steps, involving many different roles and skills. There is a lot of potential in "automating" more than just code.

This framework aims to provide opinionated assistance and solutions to mobile app related problems so that we don't end up reinventing the wheel each time we start developing a new mobile app project. Some of the practices extend beyond the specifics of mobile applications, to software development in general, but this is the focus right now.
  
## Aspects covered:

- Best practices for a healthy software development process
- Concepts and implementation details for common mobile application features
- Selected tools
- Testing mobile apps

## Principles:
- Do NOT reinvent the wheel
- Find good and easy to integrate solutions to common aspects of mobile app development
- Try to minimize effort of setup, implement and maintain a solution
- AI Assisted Development - Aim to use AI as assistance in each step of the process, from ideation and concepting
- Focus on cross platform app development to minimize time and effort

This is a theoretical framework which is platform agnostic. The principles, practices and solutons can be implemented in any mobile application framework.

# Platform specific implementation of NOMAD Framework
Since this is my focus right now, the current tehnical implmenentation of the NOMAD Framework is NOMAD.Maui, which provides specifics for the .NET Maui platform.
